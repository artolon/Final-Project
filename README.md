# Final-Project

## Due Wednesday, March 9th, 2022. Presentations will occur on this day
You will be highlighting everything you have learned during this course in the final presentation. 

**Requirements**
You will need to work in your team of 2-3 people to complete the following:

- Use an api or other data source to present at least two and no more than five advanced data science techniques including supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced learning techniques we either have or have not discussed in class. These should have high performance (>80% precision and recall, or related performance metric). If not, you need to enhance your preprocessing, clean your data better, or utilize one of the other techniques we have discussed. You are free to use techniques we have not discussed, as well.
you will likely need to create some visuals to understand your data before you dive into creating models. It may or may not make sense to include those visuals in your presentation.

- Store the data you are using for your analysis in a database and use ETL to get it there. Create a data model. You are welcome to try using a cloud database to store your data, but you do not have to.
- Create a presentation of no more than 30 slides with your findings.
- Plan to share your model code in your presentation and make sure your code and explanations are as clean as possible.
- This project is focused on the models themselves, so you dont need to share ETL code in your presentation. In fact, please DO NOT unless there is a good reason to do so.
- Be prepared to give a 10-15 minute presentation. Do NOT go over 15 minutes. This is also an exercise in planning!

**Deliverables**
You must submit a link to your group github repository with:
- A jupyter notebook with all your code in it.
- A data model of the data stored in your database and a separate notebook or script with the ETL.
- A readme.md file in your repo that clearly outlines the techniques used and findings.
- A presentation that tells the story of your data and what you are predicting.
- Be prepared to give your presentation. This is strictly timeboxed at 15 minutes.

**Guidelines for your notebook:**
- Make sure much of your code is stored in functions. 
- - Try to transition out of the script mentality and more to reusable code.
- Be careful to clearly show steps for preprocessing, training, validating, and predicting.
- Make sure you are not overfitting or underfitting your model. Specify how you know.
- Write up a summary of each step you have gone through using markdown.
- Code should be neat and well documented
- Use a common repository for your team
